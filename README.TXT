NOTE: 31 files have been changed from the original The Bug Genie v3.2.7.1 release to accomplish a template change entitled nitrogen.  One disclaimer.txt file has been added and one Description of Modifications.pdf file has been added as required by section 3.3 of the Mozilla Public License 1.1: “You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.”
